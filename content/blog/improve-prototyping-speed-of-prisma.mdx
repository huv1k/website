[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/) is really great "next-generation" ORM. It enables developers to work with databases effortlessly. It had one downside and that was prototyping annoying the developer experience.

## Single command for schema changes

From [2.10.0 release](https://github.com/prisma/prisma/releases/tag/2.10.0) release everything improved with possibility run just one single command! Prisma introduced a new `prisma db` namespace for commands that operates directly against the database.

```bash
prisma db push --preview-feature
```

It greatly improves prototyping speed, because the developer is no longer required to write migrations. The command's usage is mainly for prototyping and local environments. For production environments, you should use `prisma migrate` commands to run propper database migrations.

## Save and run

If you are using [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) we can improve prototyping even more. There is [Save and Run](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/items?itemName=wk-j.save-and-run) extension, which enables us to run a command on save. You can install this extension trough `Extensions` in VScode or run this command:

```bash
code --install-extension wk-j.save-and-run
```

Next, you need to add settings file to your `Prisma` project to enable `Save and Run` to work on `schema.prisma` file.

```json showLineNumbers title=".vscode/settings.json"
{
  "saveAndRun": {
    "commands": [
      {
        "match": "schema.prisma",
        "cmd": "yarn prisma db push --preview-feature",
        "silent": false
      }
    ]
  }
}
```

Here you can see whole flow in action. It deploys a new schema to database and generates types for `PrismaClient`.

You can use `Save and run` with oter tools, such as:

- [GraphQL code generator](https://graphql-code-generator.com/) - generating code from your `GraphQL` schema
- [Nexus.js](https://nexusjs.org/) - generating code-first `GraphQL` schema

If you are not using `VSCode` you can use [Watchman](https://facebook.github.io/watchman/), [entr](https://github.com/eradman/entr) or any other tools for watching file change.
