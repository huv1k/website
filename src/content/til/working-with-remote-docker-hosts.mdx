Docker offers a convenient method for managing containers on remote hosts without exposing the Docker daemon over TCP. Using SSH as the transport protocol is secure and straightforward. This approach is excellent for deploying applications to your VPS or cloud instances.

## Basic Usage

You can access a remote Docker host by setting the `DOCKER_HOST` environment variable with an SSH URI:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@remote-host
docker ps
```

This will execute `docker ps` on the remote machine using SSH as the transport layer.

## One-liner Commands

For quick operations, you can set the environment variable inline:

```bash
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@remote-host docker ps
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@remote-host docker images
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@remote-host docker compose up -d
```

## Using SSH Config

For better convenience, configure your SSH settings in `~/.ssh/config`:

```text title=~/.ssh/config
Host docker-server
  HostName 192.168.1.100
  User deploy
  Port 22
  IdentityFile ~/.ssh/docker_key
```

Then simply reference the host alias:

```bash
export DOCKER_HOST=ssh://docker-server
docker ps
```

## Docker Compose with Remote Hosts

Docker Compose also respects the `DOCKER_HOST` variable:

```bash
DOCKER_HOST=ssh://user@remote-host docker compose up -d
```

This is particularly useful for deploying applications to staging or production environments without complex CI/CD pipelines. You can simply deploy to the remote host using Docker Compose.

## Requirements

- Docker must be installed on both local and remote machines
- SSH access to the remote host
- The remote user must have permission to run Docker commands (typically in the `docker` group)

## Security Benefits

Using SSH for Docker access provides several advantages:

- No need to expose Docker daemon on TCP ports (2375/2376)
- Leverages existing SSH authentication (keys, certificates)
- All communication is encrypted
