👋 I am Lukáš most of you know me as **Huvik**, software developer from **Czech&nbsp;Republic** passionate about **React**, **TypeScript** and **GraphQL**.

This idea about writing was in my head for a few years already. The main reason was to share my experience and knowledge with what I gathered trough my life as a developer. The second one was to improve my writing skills which were lacking last few years.

I am going to write about useful tricks and tips regarding **Next.js**, **GraphQL**, and **TypeScript**. You can expect a lot of code examples and maybe some life stories. I hope you are going to like it!
