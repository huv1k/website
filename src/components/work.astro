      <p class="pb-4">
        Worked on multiple legacy code cleanups, removing more than <b>250+</b>
        cyclic dependencies and improving code quality. Implemented best practices
        for modular design and code organization. This led to improved CI/CD times
        and reduced the number of projects that need to be checked.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Migrated multiple applications from <b>Webpack 3</b> to <b>Webpack 5</b>
        and later to <b>Vite + Rolldown</b> setup. Created multiple plugins and tools
        to optimize bundle size and prevent accidental increases or introduction of
        dev packages into production code.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Pushed the introduction of <b>federated GraphQL</b> into the stack. This allowed
        us to split our monolithic application into multiple services. This created
        a unified way to fetch data for 90% of use cases. Created tooling for GraphQL
        schema unification and promoted best <b>Relay</b>
        patterns.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Maintained frontend monorepo with more than <b>750</b> packages and <b
          >1.4 million</b
        >
        lines of TypeScript code. I worked on several improvements to enhance CI/CD
        and overall developer experience in this large codebase.
      </p>
      <p class="pb-4">
        Introduced Cloudflare Workers into the stack and changed how frontend
        applications are served. This reduced initial load time and decreased <b
          >P90</b
        > by <b>800ms</b>.
      </p>
      <p>
        Resurrected the design system and created the initial version of our new
        design system, Nucleus. The main goal was unification and introducing
        new patterns and tools for parity between React components and Figma.
